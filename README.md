Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a script that monitors RAM usage on a Linux server. When the RAM usage exceeds a specified threshold, the script will automatically send an email alert to the system administrator or a designated recipient. This helps in proactive monitoring of system resources, ensuring timely action can be taken before the server becomes unresponsive.
